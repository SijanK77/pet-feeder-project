AI Agent Integration Reflection

I used an AI agent to refine my logics and documentations. First, I asked: “Review my given English Word Code … Identify risks, edge cases, and suggest improvement.” The agent responded with [brief excerpt: e.g., “separate motor micro‑retries, log actual dispensed vs target, and guard against repeated triggers in the same window"]. I adopted [list 1–2 items you implemented], which clarified error handling and reduced false alert.
Second, I asked: “Suggests a simple hardware path on Arduino … list parts, wiring, pseudocode.” The agent recommended [brief excerpt: e.g., “HX711 + 5kg load cell, SG90/MG90S servo, IR hopper level sensor, and tare before dispensing”] and shared pseudocode for [e.g., pulsed dispensing and weight averaging]. This help me connect the simulation logic to feasible components and document calibration steps (portion_per_pulse_g and sensor averaging).
These interactions improved my final solution by [state outcomes: clearer thresholds, better logs, feasible hardware mapping]. I also noted ethical consideration discussed by the agent, such as avoiding over‑reliance on automation and providing clear alerts/manual checks. Overall, AI asistance accelerated review, revealed edge cases (e.g., alert rate‑limits and outlier filtering), and strengthened documentation quality and maintainability.
